# predict_blood_pressure_with_linear_regression

Blood pressure is the force exerted by blood on the wall of vessels, per unit area. In medicine, we speak of blood pressure (or blood pressure) to designate the pressure measured in the arteries near the heart.

High blood pressure (hypertension) is a common disease around the world. Linked to an abnormally high blood pressure in the blood vessels, it seems harmless because it is generally silent. If left untreated for an extended period of time, it can lead to serious medical complications such as a heart attack, stroke, or kidney disease. To remedy this problem, there is a desire to develop a model that predicts blood pressure, based on health measurements and limited information about the lifestyle of patients. The goal is to use this model to develop an interactive patient portal that provides an estimate of a patient's blood pressure based on their health parameters and lifestyle.
For this we have data from 1475 patients collected during the last 12 months. The data used in this study is real world data collected by ‘U.S.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Much data from this survey is available via the RNHANES package.
